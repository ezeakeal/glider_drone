Features:
    Homesickness routine:
        If no signal from groundstation received, do not disengage from balloon
        Probably send a flag (trust of glider behaviour = True/False)
            So during flight, you flick that switch in groundstation
    Dual antennas:
        Two orientations during flight (vertical, and gliding)
        So two antennas
    IMU mounted away from electronics
    LEDs for status:
        Help Debug whats going on (issue was disk mounting this time)
    Shielded servo lines
    SMS also
    Directional tracker 
    Return to sender information (like who the fuck I am)
    Better FSTAB control - must mount everytime!


Nice to have:
    Smoke trails
    Fireworks
    Loud beeper for finding
    Groundstation application which shows where the satellites are with overlay on camera!


Todo list:
    Fix the GPS tracking in the IMU module
        GPS tracking set the offset for the IMU, but tracking was degrees, IMU was radians


Flight tests:
    Shake test
    Radar test (ticknock to elsewhere)
    Parachute test
